                The race has approximately 60 competitors. Each car was required to have at least two seats. However, recently cars only need to have space to accommodate a second seat in the cockpit rather than the seat itself. Two doors are allowed; open cockpit cars do not require doors. Since 2014, all cars in the premier LMP1 category must have a roof due to safety concerns, with open-cockpit cars only permitted in the slightly slower LMP2 category. Since 2017, all prototype cars, Hypercar or LMP2, must have closed cockpits. <br>

                Although all cars compete at the same time, as of 2021 there are separate classes. A prize is awarded to the winner of each class and the overall winner. The number of classes has varied over the years, but there are now three: Hypercar, LMP2, and LMGT3.

                Successor to the Le Mans Prototype 1 (LMP1) is the custom-built Hypercar (LMH or LMDh) class. It is the top class and debuted in 2021. The new technical regulations are intended to prevent cost escalations while enabling greater variety in technical approaches and car aesthetics. <br>
                This is followed by the LMP2 class where teams are obliged to run one of four approved chassis—ORECA, Ligier, Dallara, or Multimatic/Riley—mated with a standard 4.2-litre Gibson V8 engine. ORECA is the most commonly used LMP2 chassis. LMP1 teams are not subjected to chassis and engine restrictions. Their extra power, lower weight, and more complex aerodynamics result in much quicker lap times; LMP1 cars also may use hybrid technology.
                The next class is LMGT3, which are similar to production-based sports cars.

                The Nürburgring is a 150,000-person capacity motorsports complex located in the town of Nürburg, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. It features a Grand Prix race track built in 1984, and a long Nordschleife configuration, built in the 1920s, around the village and medieval castle of Nürburg in the Eifel mountains. The north loop is 20.830 km (12.943 mi) long and contains more than 300 metres (1,000 feet) of elevation change from its lowest to highest points. Scottish racing driver Jackie Stewart nicknamed the track "the Green Hell".

            <p>
                Originally, the track featured four configurations, namely the 28.265 km (17.563 mi)-long Gesamtstrecke, which in turn consisted of the then-22.835 km (14.189 mi) Nordschleife, and the 7.747 km (4.814 mi) Südschleife. There was also a 2.281 km (1.417 mi) warm-up loop called Zielschleife, or Betonschleife, around the pit area. Between 1982 and 1983, the start - finish area was demolished to create a new GP-Strecke, which is now used for all major and international racing events. However, the shortened Nordschleife is still in use for racing, testing and public access. <br>
                Prior to World War II, the Nürburgring hosted 13 editions of the German Grand Prix from 1927 to 1939. In Formula One (F1), it has hosted 42 Grands Prix, including the German, European, Luxembourg, and - most recently - 2020 Eifel Grand Prix; Michael Schumacher achieved the most victories at the Nürburgring, winning on five occasions between 1995 and 2006. The 1976 German Grand Prix, held on the Nordschleife, was the last F1 race ever contested on a circuit of 10 or more kilometres (6.2 or more miles). As of 2025, the venue hosts several national GT events, including the Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters.
